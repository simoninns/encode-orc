# Tests will be added here as the project develops
# For now, this is a placeholder

# Example for when Google Test is integrated:
# find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
# add_executable(encode-orc-tests test_main.cpp)
# target_link_libraries(encode-orc-tests PRIVATE GTest::GTest GTest::Main)
# add_test(NAME encode-orc-tests COMMAND encode-orc-tests)
