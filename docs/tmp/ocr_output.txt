Multiburst
The multiburst test signal for (M) NTSC,
shown in Figure 8.37, consists of a white flag
with a peak amplitude of 100 ±1 IRE and six
frequency packets, each a specific frequency.
The packets have a 40 ±1 IRE pedestal with
peak-to-peak amplitudes of 60 ±0.5 IRE. Note a
0 IRE setup is used and the starting and end-
ing point of each packet is at zero phase.
The ITU multiburst test signal for (B, D, G,
H, I) PAL, shown in Figure 8.38, consists of a 4
µs white flag with a peak amplitude of 80 ±1
IRE and six frequency packets, each a specific
frequency. The packets have a 50 ±1 IRE ped-
estal with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 60 ±0.5
IRE. Note the starting and ending points of
each packet are at zero phase. The gaps
between packets are 0.4–2.0 µs. The ITU multi-
burst test signal may be present on line 18.
The multiburst signals are used to test the
frequency response of the system by measur-
ing the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the packets.
Line Bar
The line bar is a single 100 ±0.5 IRE (refer-
ence white) pulse of 10 µs (PAL), 18 µs
(NTSC), or 25 µs (PAL) that occurs anywhere
within the active scan line time (rise and fall
times are ≤ 1 µs). Note that the color burst is
not present, and a 0 IRE setup is used. This
test signal is used to measure line time distor-
tion (line tilt or H tilt). A digital encoder or
decoder does not generate line time distortion;
the distortion is generated primarily by the
analog filters and transmission channel.
Multipulse
The (M) NTSC multipulse contains a 2T
pulse and 25T and 12.5T pulses with various
high-frequency components, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.39. The (B, D, G, H, I) PAL multipulse is
similar, except 20T and 10T pulses are used,
and there is no 7.5 IRE setup. This test signal is
typically used to measure the frequency
response of the transmission channel.

Field Square Wave
The field square wave contains 100 ±0.5
IRE pulses for the entire active line time for
Field 1 and blanked scan lines for Field 2. Note
that the color burst is not present and a 0 IRE
setup is used. This test signal is used to mea-
sure field time distortion (field tilt or V tilt). A
digital encoder or decoder does not generate
field time distortion; the distortion is gener-
ated primarily by the analog filters and trans-
mission channel.
Composite Test Signal
NTC-7 Version for NTSC
The NTC (U. S. Network Transmission
Committee) has developed a composite test
signal that may be used to test several video
parameters, rather than using multiple test
signals. The NTC-7 composite test signal for
NTSC systems (shown in Figure 8.40) con-
sists of a 100 IRE line bar, a 2T pulse, a 12.5T
chrominance pulse, and a 5-step modulated
staircase signal.

±25 ns.
The NTC-7 composite test signal may be
present on line 17.
ITU Version for PAL
The ITU (BT.628 and BT.473) has devel-
oped a composite test signal that may be used
to test several video parameters, rather than
using multiple test signals. The ITU composite
test signal for PAL systems (shown in Figure
8.41) consists of a white flag, a 2T pulse, and a
5-step modulated staircase signal.
The white flag has a peak amplitude of 100
±1 IRE and a width of 10 µs.
The 2T pulse has a peak amplitude of 100
±0.5 IRE, with a half-amplitude width of 200

The 5-step modulated staircase signal con-
sists of 5 luminance steps (whose IRE values
are shown in Figure 8.41) superimposed with a
42.86 ±0.5 IRE subcarrier that has a phase of
60° ±1° relative to the U axis. The rise and fall
times of each modulation packet envelope are
approximately 1 µs.

U.K. Version
The United Kingdom allows the use of a
slightly different test signal since the 10T
pulse is more sensitive to delay errors than the
20T pulse (at the expense of occupying less
chrominance bandwidth). Selection of an
appropriate pulse width is a trade-off between
occupying the PAL chrominance bandwidth as
fully as possible and obtaining a pulse with suf-
ficient sensitivity to delay errors. Thus, the
national test signal (developed by the British
Broadcasting Corporation and the Indepen-
dent Television Authority) in Figure 8.42 may
be present on lines 19 and 332 for (I) PAL sys-
tems in the United Kingdom.
The white flag has a peak amplitude of 100
±1 IRE and a width of 10 µs.
The 2T pulse has a peak amplitude of 100
±0.5 IRE, with a half-amplitude width of 200
±10 ns.
The 10T chrominance pulse has a peak
amplitude of 100 ±0.5 IRE.
The 5-step modulated staircase signal con-
sists of 5 luminance steps (whose IRE values
are shown in Figure 8.42) superimposed with a
21.43 ±0.5 IRE subcarrier that has a phase of
60° ±1° relative to the U axis. The rise and fall
times of each modulation packet envelope is
approximately 1 µs.

Combination Test Signal
NTC-7 Version for NTSC
The NTC (U. S. Network Transmission
Committee) has also developed a combination
test signal that may be used to test several
video parameters, rather than using multiple
test signals. The NTC-7 combination test sig-
nal for NTSC systems (shown in Figure 8.43)
consists of a white flag, a multiburst, and a
modulated pedestal signal.
The white flag has a peak amplitude of 100
±1 IRE and a width of 4 µs.
The multiburst has a 50 ±1 IRE pedestal
with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 50 ±0.5 IRE.
The starting point of each frequency packet is
at zero phase. The width of the 0.5 MHz packet
is 5 µs; the width of the remaining packets is 3
µs.
The 3-step modulated pedestal is com-
posed of a 50 IRE luminance pedestal, superim-
posed with three amplitudes of modulated
chrominance (20 ±0.5, 40 ±0.5, and 80 ±0.5 IRE
peak-to-peak) that have a phase of –90° ±1° rel-
ative to the burst. The rise and fall times of
each modulation packet envelope are 400 ±25
ns.
The NTC-7 combination test signal may be
present on line 280.
ITU Version for PAL
The ITU (BT.473) has developed a combi-
nation test signal that may be used to test sev-
eral video parameters, rather than using
multiple test signals. The ITU combination test
signal for PAL systems (shown in Figure 8.44)
consists of a white flag, a 2T pulse, a 20T mod-
ulated chrominance pulse, and a 5-step lumi-
nance staircase signal.

ITU ITS Version for PAL
The ITU (BT.473) has developed a combi-
nation ITS (insertion test signal) that may be
used to test several PAL video parameters,
rather than using multiple test signals. The
ITU combination ITS for PAL systems (shown
in Figure 8.45) consists of a 3-step modulated
pedestal with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 20,
60, and 100 ±1 IRE, and an extended subcar-
rier packet with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 60
±1 IRE. The rise and fall times of each subcar-
rier packet envelope are approximately 1 µs.
The phase of each subcarrier packet is 60°
±1° relative to the U axis. The tolerance on the
50 IRE level is ±1 IRE.
The ITU composite ITS may be present on
line 331.
U. K. Version
The United Kingdom allows the use of a
slightly different test signal, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.46. It may be present on lines 20 and 333
for (I) PAL systems in the United Kingdom.
The test signal consists of a 50 IRE lumi-
nance bar, part of which has a 100 IRE subcar-
rier superimposed that has a phase of 60°
±1° relative to the U axis, and an extended
burst of subcarrier on the second half of the
scan line.
