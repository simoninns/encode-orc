# Vision statement
The aim of encode-orc is to be an application (standalone, command line, C++17) that can produce test data for decode-orc.

encoder-orc should be able to produce:

- PAL Composite - video.tbc and video.tbc.db
- PAL YC - video.tbcy, video.tbcc and video.tbc.db
- NTSC Composite - video.tbc and video.tbc.db
- NTSC YC - video.tbcy, video.tbcc and video.tbc.db

where tbc.db is a metadata file in ld-decode's SQLite format:

https://happycube.github.io/ld-decode-docs/Development/tools-metadata-format.html

and .tbc is a composite field-based video file, .tbcc is a chroma field-based video file and .tbcy is a luma field-based video file.

The actual encoding should be based around the ld-chroma-encoder source found here (as a sub-part of ld-chroma-decoder):

https://github.com/happycube/ld-decode/tree/main/tools/ld-chroma-decoder

The application should take raw RGB frame information (in PAL or NTSC dimensions) and generate other data such as VITS, VBI, sync pulses, etc. according to various command line switches that specify the use of time-codes/frame numbers and so on.

Eventually the tool should allow useful testing functions such as adding in dropouts, creating 'noise' in the video, etc.

Ideally the primary input RGB will be NTSC and PAL testcards (although real video data should be good too) over which the tool can overlay other information such as a OSD style frame number or other items to make each generated frame or field unique.

# Test cards
## NTSC (North America, Japan, parts of South America) 

- RCA "Indian-head" test pattern: This monochrome pattern was widely used in North America from the 1940s to the 1970s and became an iconic symbol of early television. It was generated by a special camera tube called a monoscope.
- SMPTE color bars: In the color television era, the standard test pattern became the SMPTE color bars (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers), which includes calibrated color bars and "blacker-than-black" references to help calibrate color, brightness, and contrast on receivers and professional equipment. 

## PAL (Europe, Australia, parts of Asia and South America)

- BBC Test Card F: Created by the British Broadcasting Corporation, this well-known test card was used for over four decades in the UK and other countries. It featured a young girl (Carole Hersee) playing tic-tac-toe and served a comprehensive range of alignment functions.
- Philips PM5544: Developed in Denmark by Philips, this pattern became a de facto standard across many European countries and other regions that adopted the PAL system. It's a colorful, geometrically complex pattern designed for precise adjustments of consumer and professional displays.
- EBU color bars: The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) developed its own color bar standard, often incorporated into the more complex test cards, similar in function to the NTSC SMPTE bars.
